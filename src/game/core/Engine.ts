/**
 * Engine is responsible for initializing and managing the core systems of the game.
 * It sets up the required systems and allows starting or stopping them as needed.
 * 
 *
 * Responsibilities:
 * - Registers core game systems (Input, Battle, Damage) during initialization.
 * - Cleans up all systems when stopping the game.
 * - Acts as the entry point for system orchestration.
 *
 * Dependencies:
 * - `EventBus`: Enables decoupled communication between systems and UI components.
 * - `World`: Represents all game entities and their components.
 * - `SystemManager`: Handles system registration and lifecycle.
 *
 * Methods:
 * - `start()`: Registers all necessary systems and logs the setup.
 * - `stop()`: Unregisters all systems and logs the shutdown.
 *
 * Notes:
 * - There is no main game loop; instead, systems react to dispatched events such as user input.
 * - This class is typically called from a higher-level `Game.ts` controller.
